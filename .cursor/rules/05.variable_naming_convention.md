# ⭐⑸✅ Variable Naming Convention

When naming variables, follow these guidelines:
1. Use lowercase letters for variable names.
2. Use underscores to separate words in variable names.
3. Use meaningful names that describe the purpose of the variable.
4. Use consistent naming conventions for related variables.
5. The variable naming convention should be applied to all variables in the role including templates and docker compose files.
6. Inform the user that rule ⭐⑸✅ has been applied.
