2. ensure you are using the correct Traefik labels and networksas defined in rules/05.traefik.md
3. ensure ansible variables are added using {{ variable }}
4. ensure you work out a good resource requirement for the application being run and put relevant resource limits in the docker compose file.
5. Inform the user that rule ⭐⑦✅ has been applied.
