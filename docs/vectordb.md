## Integration Considerations

### AI Agent Integration
```python
# Example integration points
class VectorDBManager:
    def __init__(self, db_type):
        self.db = self._initialize_db(db_type)
    
    def store_embeddings(self, data):
        # Common storage pattern
        pass
    
    def search_similar(self, query):
        # Similarity search
        pass
    
    def batch_process(self, items):
        # Batch operations
        pass
```
